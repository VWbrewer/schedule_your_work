# schedule_your_work
Application to schedule your work by creating a list that can be saved


## Description
This application is for scheduling your day. You are able to schedule be each hour during typical business hours.
I made this to help me organize and plan my day, so that I am not over booked. I learned that there are lots of sources that can be used for api's. 



Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
