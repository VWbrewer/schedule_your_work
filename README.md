# schedule_your_work
Application to schedule your work by creating a list that can be saved


## Description
This application is for scheduling your day. You are able to schedule be each hour during typical business hours.
I made this to help me organize and plan my day, so that I am not over booked. I learned that there are lots of sources that can be used for api's. 
This is a great for anyone struggling to keep track of what they need to do during the day.
